    <p>Hello, I am <span class="profile-name">Eunice Miraflores Dimacuta</span></p>
   
    <p>I'm 26 years old, living in the Philippines. In 2017-2018, I served my mission in the Philippines Urdaneta Mission. 
    I enjoy anime, sunrises, and sunsets. In my leisure time, I usually play basketball, play video games, and ride my 
    bike to the beach to enjoy the view and breeze. I also enjoy watching movies that pique my interest. I also enjoy museums, 
    which feels like a trip back in time.
    </p>
    <p>I'm grateful for BYU Idaho, which allows me to hone and improve my skills while also learning and sharing experiences with you.</p>
